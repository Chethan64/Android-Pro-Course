# Week 1 - Introduction to Android and Android Studio

Hey there, your journey to becoming an Android Pro begins now!

This week we'll learn the basics and fundaments of Android.

To develop Android Apps, we use the official IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for Android development called Android Studio.
<br>So lets go step by step,<br>
### Instaling Android Studio

- [Download Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/) for Windows ,Mac or Linux.
- Installation should be straight forward. For Windows, just run the download and the follow the setup wizard. You can check [this](https://developer.android.com/studio/install) out for a complete run down of the installation if you get stuck.
- You should hopefully see the welcome screen. Setup a new project like this. You can change the company domain to your name, but I'd recommend keeping the application name the same for now so it'll be easier to follow along.

### Setting Up Your Android Device
To run our app, we need to setup our Android Device or create an emulator. I would recommend using your physical Android device as the emulator can be slow and unreliable. Plus personally, I think being able to touch and interact with it (as how the users would) really gives you a correct assesment of the UX. <br> Check out [this](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/running-app) document for how to connect your device or create an emulator.

### Running the app
On running the app, the app should be installed onto your device and would open automatically. The contents of the app should look somewhat like this.

Cool so you've basically set up everything! As you can see, when you created the project, Android Studio already made the default "Hello World" app for you. Let's have a look at the files which have been generated for this default app.

### Project Files
Have a look at the files pane on the left side of your window. It consists of a bunch of different folders & files. Currently, it should look something like this.
